- ansi_terminal: use proper escape sequences in Windows

- echoless input for the key (can be disabled in options)

- Normalize() should handle letters with accent

  by default and could be enabled with an option. If disabled (batch mode) application should
  fail if given incomplete arguments

- switch to getopts in main()
